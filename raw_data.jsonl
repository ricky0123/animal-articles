The objective of this study was to determine how secretory (fecal) and plasma immunoglobulin-A (IgA) levels in fast-growing broilers respond to positive and negative housing conditions. In three replicated experiments, male Ross 708 broilers (<i>n</i> = 1650/experiment) were housed in a 2 \u00d7 2 factorial study of high or low environmental complexity and high or low stocking density. In experiments 1 and 3 but not in experiment 2, high complexity tended to positively impact day 48 plasma IgA concentrations. When three experiments were combined, high complexity positively impacted day 48 plasma IgA concentrations. Stocking density and the complexity \u00d7 density interaction did not impact day 48 plasma IgA concentrations. Environmental complexity and the complexity \u00d7 density interaction did not impact day 48 secretory IgA concentrations. A high stocking density negatively impacted day 48 secretory IgA concentrations overall but not in individual experiments. These results suggest that environmental complexity decreased chronic stress, while a high stocking density increased chronic stress. Thus, plasma IgA levels increased under high-complexity housing conditions (at day 48), and secretory IgA levels (at day 48) decreased under high-density conditions, suggesting that chronic stress differed among treatments. Therefore, these measures may be useful for quantifying chronic stress but only if the statistical power is high. Future research should replicate these findings under similar and different housing conditions to confirm the suitability of IgA as a measure of chronic stress in broiler chickens.", "title": "Measuring Chronic Stress in Broiler Chickens: Effects of Environmental Complexity and Stocking Density on Immunoglobulin-A Levels"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "id": "00c4480fb4004ceb9b547a6ff807de6e", "created_date": "2023-07-13T14:06:38Z"}, {"last_updated": "2023-03-10T14:01:43Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "10.3390/ani13050826", "type": "doi"}, {"id": "2076-2615", "type": "eissn"}], "journal": {"volume": "13", "number": "826", "country": "CH", "issns": ["2076-2615"], "publisher": "MDPI AG", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Animals"}, "month": "02", "keywords": ["didactics of ethics", "animal ethics", "flipped classroom", "online teaching", "empirical evaluation"], "year": "2023", "start_page": "826", "subject": [{"code": "SF600-1100", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Veterinary medicine"}, {"code": "QL1-991", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Zoology"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "Unit of Ethics and Human-Animal-Studies, Messerli Research Institute, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Medical University of Vienna, University of Vienna, 1210 Vienna, Austria", "name": "Katharina Dieck"}, {"affiliation": "Unit of Ethics and Human-Animal-Studies, Messerli Research Institute, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Medical University of Vienna, University of Vienna, 1210 Vienna, Austria", "name": "Herwig Grimm"}], "link": [{"content_type": "text/html", "type": "fulltext", "url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/13/5/826"}], "abstract": "Despite the challenges the pandemic presented for university teaching, it opened up opportunities to set up and explore digital teaching formats like never before. This paper presents a case study of teaching introductory animal ethics in a digital format with flipped-classroom methods.

Maximum transparency in an application-oriented exam; 4. No further contribution to the workload of the teaching staff; 5. Flexibility regarding online or on-site conversions. Rather than provide the students with input in lecture sessions, the ILLF presents students with selected literature and a list of structured questions. This literature questionnaire serves as the main didactic element that guides the knowledge transfer, the structure of the sessions and the exam. This paper reviews the outcome of the redesigning process and the steps we took to implement it. To discuss the overall quality of the format from a student\u2019s perspective, the data from the systematically conducted students\u2019 evaluation (<i>n</i> = 65) are interpreted using quantitative and qualitative methods. Bringing these results together with the perspective of the teaching staff, the following question is discussed: did the ILLF meet these criteria?

The current study aimed to investigate play-related factors associated with four welfare outcome measures in cats (Felis catus) including: cat quality of life; cat-guardian relationship quality; problem behaviour prevalence; and behavioural changes. An online survey was developed using demographic information, questions related to play and resources, free text sections and the following validated measures: cat quality of life (QOL), the cat owner relationship scale, and the adult playfulness trait scale. Responses were completed by 1,591 cat guardians from 55 countries. Higher cat playfulness scores and a greater number of games played were significantly associated with higher cat QOL scores while longer amounts of daily play, greater number of games, both cat and guardian initiating play and higher guardian playfulness scores were all significantly associated with higher cat-guardian relationship scores. Exclusively indoor housing was significantly associated with both higher cat QOL and higher cat-guardian relationships scores compared to cats with outdoor access. Behavioural changes associated with distress in cats were reported when play was absent. Play may be an important factor in assessing and maintaining cat welfare.

Sows were mixed into 12 stable groups (six groups per treatment, 20 sows per group), 29 days post-service in pens with free-access, full-length individual feeding/lying stalls.

IMPROVED pens were the same but with rubber mats and a length of manila rope in each feeding stall, and straw provided in three racks in the group area. Direct observations of oral stereotypical (30 instantaneous scans per sow per day) and aggressive (all-occurrence sampling, 3 h per sow per day) behaviours were conducted 72 h post-mixing, in mid and late gestation. Skin lesions were counted 24 h and three weeks post-mixing, and in late gestation. Sows\u2019 locomotion (locomotory ability) was scored using a visual analogue scale in mid and late gestation. Right and left eye tear staining was scored in late gestation. Indications of better welfare in IMPROVED sows included performance of fewer oral stereotypies in mid and late gestation, and lower tear stain scores.

Different authors also stress the reciprocal links among the 3Rs, and how these often complement and reinforce each other. We very much agree with this point, but in this contribution we would like to raise some problems related to the application of the \u201c3Rs\u201d. There is an obvious link among \u201cReplacement, \u201cReduction\u201d and \u201cRefinement\u201d, but it is worth to notice also that each \u201cR\u201d has its own conceptual characteristics, as well as its own level of applicability. For example, a realistic \u201cmethodological inertia\u201d has to be expected more in the case of \u201cReplacement\u201d than in the case of \u201cRefinement\u201d. This also leads to a second order of issues, and here we will offer our experience as projects evaluators. The \u201c3Rs\u201d differ also in the possibility to verify how are applied by the proponents of research protocols involving the use of animal models. Sometimes it appears that the application of the Principle still resolves itself in the use of formulaic sentences, from which it is difficult to really understand the reality of the laboratory decisional and procedural processes. However, the demanding characteristics of the \u201c3Rs\u201d can vary greatly, and this is something that has to be considered. We propose that a network, or a virtual platform, of evaluators could help both researchers and evaluators for a more satisfactory understanding and pragmatic application of the Principle of the 3Rs.", "title": "The principle of the 3Rs between aspiration and reality"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "id": "00002b05e6b649e79886fb50fceb689c", "created_date": "2022-08-12T05:41:18Z"}, {"last_updated": "2023-01-06T13:53:58Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "10.3390/ani13010143", "type": "doi"}, {"id": "2076-2615", "type": "eissn"}], "journal": {"volume": "13", "number": "143", "country": "CH", "issns": ["2076-2615"], "publisher": "MDPI AG", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Animals"}, "month": "12", "keywords": ["male mice", "group housing", "aggression", "animal welfare", "environmental enrichment", "group formation"], "year": "2022", "start_page": "143", "subject": [{"code": "SF600-1100", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Veterinary medicine"}, {"code": "QL1-991", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Zoology"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "Department of Animal Environment and Health, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, 532 23 Skara, Sweden", "name": "Elin M.

Valid indicators that are practical to measure are needed to assess welfare status and survival likelihood for stranded cetaceans. The Delphi method was applied to gather international and interdisciplinary expert opinion to provide face validity to potential indicators of stranded cetacean welfare and survival likelihood. Two online questionnaires were conducted. In the first questionnaire these experts identified potential indicators of stranded cetacean welfare and survival likelihood. These indicators were subsequently scored by the same experts in questionnaire two, based on their value for assessing welfare/survival likelihood and being practical to measure. Indicators considered valuable and practical for assessing welfare and survival likelihood at strandings included animal-based indices of body and skin condition, signs of physical trauma, respiration rate and various behaviours.

The survey (<i>n</i> = 93 respondents) collected information regarding institutional policies and procedures for pain recognition, methods used for pain relief, and perceived levels of confidence in primate pain assessment. Results indicated that 71% (<i>n</i> = 60) of respondents worked at institutions that were without formal experimental pain assessment policies. Pain assessment methods were consistent across respondents with the majority evaluating pain based on changes in general activity levels (100%, <i>n</i> = 86) and food consumption (97%, <i>n</i> = 84). Self-reported confidence in recognizing and managing pain ranged from slightly confident to highly confident, and there was a commonly expressed concern about the lack of objective pain assessment tools and science-based evidence regarding therapeutic recommendations of analgesics for research primates. These opinions correspond with significant gaps in the primate pain management literature, including limited specific pharmacokinetic data and efficacy testing for commonly used analgesics in research primate species as well as limited research on objective and specific measures of pain in research primates. These results demonstrate that there are inconsistencies in institutional policies and procedures surrounding pain management in research primates and a lack of objective pain assessment methods.

Although multiple factors contribute to these differences, we can summarize them into a three pillar concept, the three aspects of applied farm AW. The objective of this review is to analyse applied AW on farms from the ethical, economic and animal health aspects. Modern ethics emphasizes biocentrism against anthropocentrism, the modern ethical concept of bioethics. Additionally, beside the differences among the major ethical concepts, there is a consensus that AW deserves a respectful place. An animal\u2019s economic value is not only limited by its material value determined by the inputs and outputs. Thus, rather than being simply considered as a \u201cstock-good\u201d machine, animals are valued as a sentient beings with \u201cadded value\u201d, which has an impact on the final product price. Animal health and welfare are interconnected and are based on the impact of AW on health and vice versa. The implementation of higher welfare standards to farm animals is only possible if AW is accepted as part of the health of the animal. The applicability of this concept is presented through the European Union AW legislation, which is based on public opinion, economy and animal health. As a conclusion, applied AW is possible only at the level at which the three pillars are equally balanced, and the initiatives in this field should work and be focused on ethics, economics and health.", "title": "The three pillars of applied farm animal welfare"}, "id": "01fce827583f4fd496ec9b3e71357ab6", "created_date": "2022-01-28T12:51:49Z"}, {"last_updated": "2022-12-21T17:40:52Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "10.3390/su13063328", "type": "doi"}, {"id": "2071-1050", "type": "eissn"}], "journal": {"volume": "13", "number": "3328", "country": "CH", "issns": ["2071-1050"], "publisher": "MDPI AG", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Sustainability"}, "month": "03", "keywords": ["sustainability", "animal welfare", "education for sustainable development (ESD)", "learning environment", "critical thinking"], "year": "2021", "start_page": "3328", "subject": [{"code": "TD194-195", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Environmental effects of industries and plants"}, {"code": "TJ807-830", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Renewable energy sources"}, {"code": "GE1-350", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Environmental sciences"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "Department of Clinical Sciences, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, P.O.

While both species showed an accuracy reduction following the change of the gap position, goats recovered from this perseveration error from the second B trial onwards, whereas sheep did so only in the fourth B trial, indicating differences in behavioural flexibility between the species.

This is challenging, since these properties are private and cannot be observed directly. Certain motivations, emotions and related internal states can be inferred in animals through experiments that involve choice, learning, generalization and decision-making. Yet, even though there is significant progress in elucidating the neurobiology of human consciousness, animal consciousness is still a mystery. We propose that computational animal welfare science emerges at the intersection of animal behaviour, welfare and computational cognition. By using ideas from cognitive science, we develop a functional and generic definition of subjective phenomena as any process or state of the organism that exists from the first-person perspective and cannot be isolated from the animal subject. We then outline a general cognitive architecture to model simple forms of subjective processes and sentience. This includes evolutionary adaptation which contains top-down attention modulation, predictive processing and subjective simulation by re-entrant (recursive) computations. Thereafter, we show how this approach uses major characteristics of the subjective experience: elementary self-awareness, global workspace and qualia with unity and continuity. This provides a formal framework for process-based modelling of animal needs, subjective states, sentience and wellbeing.", "title": "Computational animal welfare: towards cognitive architecture models of animal sentience, emotion and wellbeing"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "id": "02cc3eb641954104bfe09e989006e3ca", "created_date": "2021-01-28T14:45:35Z"}, {"last_updated": "2022-12-22T02:21:54Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "2575-8314", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.1002/pan3.10070", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "2", "number": "1", "country": "GB", "issns": ["2575-8314"], "publisher": "Wiley", "language": ["EN"], "title": "People and Nature"}, "month": "03", "end_page": "110", "keywords": ["African elephant conservation", "animal refugee", "animal rights", "animal sovereignty", "animal welfare", "Loxodonta africana"], "year": "2020", "start_page": "103", "subject": [{"code": "GF1-900", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Human ecology.

In response, authors in the humanities and the sciences have described animals rhetorically as \u2018refugees\u2019. Such a description implies a strong call to action. However, the term \u2018refugee\u2019 may serve as more than mere rhetoric, indicating in a more literal way the response most proper to some persecuted, traumatized and displaced animals, and prioritizing those animals. We test the claim that animals can be refugees using widely accepted criteria in the Refugee Convention. If refugees are those who, due to a well\u2010founded fear of persecution for reasons of their group identity, are unwilling or unable to avail themselves of the protection of their country, then some animals may be refugees. Recent behavioural research on African elephants Loxodonta africana demonstrates that many elephants meet the criteria, even without recourse to the claim that they are persons. We outline the essential requirements of an animal refugee policy. We find that current biodiversity conservation policy is likely inadequate to provide for animal refugees, although important lessons can be taken from the collective experience of conservation scientists and managers. An obligation to animal refugees poses new challenges, both theoretical and practical, for ecological restoration, conservation and human\u2013animal relations.

The effects of this program on some welfare and product quality measures were investigated, both immediately and six months post training. The welfare measures that showed significant improvements post training included; flapping at shackling, pre-stun shocks, stun parameters and effective neck cut. Product quality measures including broken wings and red pygostyles also improved, however the positive effect of training was not seen in all quality measures.

Mass vaccination of the dog population has proven effective and rabies cases in dogs and people have decreased, however the virus is still circulating among the dog population. Vaccination coverage must be maintained until rabies elimination. Increasing efficiency and effectiveness of vaccination campaigns is therefore desired. Community engagement leading to preventative health actions by community members can reduce disease incidence and costs of control. Here we evaluate 2 years of a novel community-based dog welfare and rabies control project (Program Dharma) in the Sanur sub-district. The project engaged the services of people living in the project area with an interest or experience in dogs or community health services. These people spoke with owners within their own community about dog welfare and health, monitored owned and unowned dogs and increased owner and carer efforts to access vaccination and further veterinary services. The evaluation focused on a sample of dogs whose owners had been regularly engaged with project. Vaccination coverage was increased and there were no dog or human rabies cases reported in the project area; the percentage of the dogs that had never been vaccinated was reduced by an average 28.3% (baseline unvaccinated 41\u201349%, post-project unvaccinated 11\u201319%). The welfare of dogs improved from an average of 20.7% of dogs with visible welfare problems at baseline to 2.7% after project implementation. Roaming dog density observed on street surveys also decreased in all project areas (24\u201347% reduction dependent on desa). A participatory evaluation event with a sample of Program Dharma community-based agents highlighted several additional successes, including that the community appeared to welcome and value their services and were beginning to support the cost of project activities. Conversely, challenges included identifying dogs in the database during revisits, sustaining the costs of community member time spent working on Program Dharma activities and the costs of veterinary care, whilst avoiding dependency of owners on free veterinary services. The benefits revealed by the evaluation were judged to be sufficient to extend Program Dharma to new areas, whilst evolving activities to resolve challenges.", "title": "Evaluation of Community-Based Dog Welfare and Rabies Project in Sanur, a Sub-district of the Indonesian Island Province of Bali"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "created_date": "2019-07-09T05:29:38Z", "id": "05e0e92db8174141a759ab6272297919"}, {"last_updated": "2022-12-21T20:02:25Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "2297-1769", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.3389/fvets.2019.00113", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "6", "country": "CH", "issns": ["2297-1769"], "publisher": "Frontiers Media S.A.", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Frontiers in Veterinary Science"}, "month": "4", "keywords": ["pets", "animal welfare", "disaster", "PTSD", "evacuation", "shelter"], "year": "2019", "subject": [{"code": "SF600-1100", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Veterinary medicine"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "Department of Wildlife Medicine, Nippon Veterinary and Life Science University, Tokyo, Japan", "name": "Aki Tanaka"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Population Health and Reproduction, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, United States", "name": "Aki Tanaka"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Veterinary Internal Medicine, Osaka Prefecture University, Osaka, Japan", "name": "Jun Saeki"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Wildlife Medicine, Nippon Veterinary and Life Science University, Tokyo, Japan", "name": "Shin-ichi Hayama"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Population Health and Reproduction, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, United States", "name": "Philip H.

Public attention to the welfare of affected animals in this disaster triggered an awareness of the importance of caring for their needs. However, research on human behavior toward pets or effect of pets on human during disasters remains sparse. In this study, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) scores among pet-owners and non-pet owners in Japan's 2011 earthquake disaster were compared, and attitudes toward pets were evaluated. A questionnaire was distributed to attendees, and interviews were performed at an annual animal welfare event. The Japanese-language version of the revised Impact of Event Scale was used to evaluate PTSD from the disaster. PTSD scores were higher in pet-owners compared to non-pet owners immediately after the earthquakes, but were lower in pet-owners compared to non-pet owners 4.4 years following the disaster. Most people opined that pets should evacuate with people, although less than half of non-pet owners agreed with having animals co-located at evacuation centers. In order to enhance safety and security of both humans and animals at evacuation centers, it is important to proactively address animal issues in disaster preparedness planning.

The biggest knowledge improvement was among Thai respondents, who tended to be younger and less experienced than in other countries. The respondents with the biggest improvement in knowledge scores were most likely to be involved in the dairy industry and least likely to be involved in the sheep and goat industries, with meat processors and those involved in pig or poultry production intermediate. The respondents who obtained their knowledge from multiple sources had most knowledge, but it increased the least after training. Connections between attitudes to improving animal welfare and knowledge were limited, being mainly confined to ambivalent responses about their attitudes.

However, there is little or no information on the attitude of the Australian public towards this trade. A total of 522 Australians were surveyed in Brisbane to find out about their understanding of the trade, their attitudes towards it and the influence of demographic factors. Approximately one half of respondents were surveyed just before a media expos&eacute; of cruelty on sheep shipments in 2017 from Australia to the Middle East and one half just after the expos&eacute;, to see the impact of media depiction of cruel treatment of live export sheep. Most respondents believed that they were familiar with the industry, and more after the media expos&eacute; than before. More respondents had negative than positive feelings about the trade, and just over a quarter had no feelings. Twice as many thought it should be ended than maintained, particularly women, but 40% said that it depends, mainly on ethics and animal-based reasons. Those that thought it should not be ended mainly did so to support farmers and the country&rsquo;s economy. Almost one half had seen the media expos&eacute;, particularly older respondents, and expressions of sadness, empathy for the animals and anger were the most common responses to such footage. Although it increased the number of people saying that they were familiar with the trade, it did not affect people&rsquo;s view of the trade, except that fewer indicated that ending the trade was dependent on other factors. It is concluded that the majority of Australian respondents in one capital city had negative views towards the live export trade, and that a media expos&eacute; had some influence on this view.", "title": "Australian Public Opinions Regarding the Live Export Trade before and after an Animal Welfare Media Expos\u00e9"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "created_date": "2018-07-02T07:20:21Z", "id": "004ea8a4c21040e78b07bc38a33583b1"}, {"last_updated": "2022-12-21T21:57:27Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "2306-7381", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.3390/vetsci5030066", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "5", "number": "3", "country": "CH", "issns": ["2306-7381"], "publisher": "MDPI AG", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Veterinary Sciences"}, "month": "7", "keywords": ["animal welfare", "veterinary education", "Day One Competence", "gender", "veterinary ethics", "humane endpoint", "3Rs", "research animals", "euthanasia", "conscientious objection"], "year": "2018", "start_page": "66", "subject": [{"code": "SF600-1100", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Veterinary medicine"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "School of Veterinary and Life Science, Murdoch University, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia", "name": "Teresa Collins"}, {"affiliation": "Sydney School of Veterinary Science, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia", "name": "Amelia Cornish"}, {"affiliation": "School of Veterinary and Life Science, Murdoch University, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia", "name": "Jennifer Hood"}, {"affiliation": "Research for Social Change, Faculty of Social Science, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia", "name": "Chris Degeling"}, {"affiliation": "Faculty of Veterinary and Agricultural Sciences, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC 3010, Australia", "name": "Andrew  D.

Hence, veterinary schools have an opportunity to raise animal health and welfare standards by improving veterinary students&rsquo; animal welfare and ethics (AWE) education, including that related to animals used for scientific purposes. A survey of 851 students in the early, mid, and senior stages of their courses at all eight veterinary schools across Australia and New Zealand was undertaken on their first day of practice (or Day One Competences) to explore how veterinary students viewed the importance of their competence in the management of welfare and ethical decision-making relating to animals kept for scientific purposes. From highest to lowest, the rankings they assigned were: Animal Ethics Committee (AEC) Procedures or Requirements; 3Rs (Replacement, Refinement and Reduction); Humane Endpoints; Euthanasia; &ldquo;What Is a Research Animal?&rdquo;; and Conscientious Objections. Female students rated Conscientious Objections, Humane Endpoints, and Euthanasia significantly higher than male students did across the three stages of study. The score patterns for these three variates showed a trend for the male students to be more likely to score these topics as extremely important as they advanced through the course, but female students&rsquo; scores tended to decline slightly or stay relatively stable. No gender differences emerged for the three variates: 3Rs (Replacement, Refinement and Reduction); AEC Procedures or Requirements; and &ldquo;What Is a Research Animal?&rdquo;.

In humans, this bias can be mediated by the observer&rsquo;s affective state and is implicated in the onset and maintenance of affective disorders such as anxiety. Affect-driven attention biases (ADABs) have also been identified in a few other species. Here, we review the literature on ADABs in animals and discuss their utility as welfare indicators. Despite a limited research effort, several studies have found that negative affective states modulate attention to negative (i.e., threatening) cues. ADABs influenced by positive-valence states have also been documented in animals. We discuss methods for measuring ADAB and conclude that looking time, dot-probe, and emotional spatial cueing paradigms are particularly promising. Research is needed to test them with a wider range of species, investigate attentional scope as an indicator of affect, and explore the possible causative role of attention biases in determining animal wellbeing. Finally, we argue that ADABs might not be best-utilized as indicators of general valence, but instead to reveal specific emotions, motivations, aversions, and preferences.

A total of 500 households living in Seoul in 2013 participated in the CV survey to report their willingness to pay (WTP) for the release. Fifty-two percent were willing to accept an increase in local taxes over the next five years to carry out the release. The mean household WTP estimate was obtained as KRW 4880 (USD 4.56) per annum. The present values of the total WTP and the cost of the release are KRW 79.82 billion (USD 74.53 million) and KRW 751 million (USD 701,000), respectively, in 2013.

To assess mood (moderately long-term affective states), the cognitive judgment bias test was developed and has been widely used in various animal species. However, little is known about how mood changes, how mood can be experimentally manipulated, and how mood then feeds back into cognitive judgment. A recent theory argues that mood reflects the cumulative impact of differences between obtained outcomes and expectations. Here expectations refer to an established context. Situations in which an established context fails to match an outcome are then perceived as mismatches of expectation and outcome. We take advantage of the large number of studies published on non-verbal cognitive bias tests in recent years (95 studies with a total of 162 independent tests) to test whether cumulative mismatch could indeed have led to the observed mood changes. Based on a criteria list, we assessed whether mismatch had occurred with the experimental procedure used to induce mood (mood induction mismatch), or in the context of the non-verbal cognitive bias procedure (testing mismatch). For the mood induction mismatch, we scored the mismatch between the subjects\u2019 potential expectations and the manipulations conducted for inducing mood whereas, for the testing mismatch, we scored mismatches that may have occurred during the actual testing. We then investigated whether these two types of mismatch can predict the actual outcome of the cognitive bias study. The present evaluation shows that mood induction mismatch cannot well predict the success of a cognitive bias test. On the other hand, testing mismatch can modulate or even inverse the expected outcome. We think, cognitive bias studies should more specifically aim at creating expectation mismatch while inducing mood states to test the cumulative mismatch theory more properly. Furthermore, testing mismatch should be avoided as much as possible because it can reverse the affective state of animals as measured in a cognitive judgment bias paradigm.", "title": "Mood As Cumulative Expectation Mismatch: A Test of Theory Based on Data from Non-verbal Cognitive Bias Tests"}, "admin": {"seal": true}, "created_date": "2017-12-14T04:22:02Z", "id": "0d2248df44f34eb1bfd72f4df1e62d39"}, {"last_updated": "2022-12-21T23:50:37Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "2071-1050", "type": "eissn"}, {"id": "10.3390/su9111999", "type": "doi"}], "journal": {"volume": "9", "number": "11", "country": "CH", "issns": ["2071-1050"], "publisher": "MDPI AG", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Sustainability"}, "month": "11", "keywords": ["consumer", "farming systems", "eggs", "preferences", "free range", "organic", "animal welfare", "nutrition claims", "discrete choice-based experiment"], "year": "2017", "start_page": "1999", "subject": [{"code": "TD194-195", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Environmental effects of industries and plants"}, {"code": "TJ807-830", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Renewable energy sources"}, {"code": "GE1-350", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Environmental sciences"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "Department of Organization and Consumption Economics, Faculty of Human Nutrition and Consumer Sciences, Warsaw University of Life Sciences (SGGW-WULS), 159C Nowoursynowska Street, 02-787 Warsaw, Poland", "name": "Sylwia \u017bakowska-Biemans"}, {"affiliation": "Department of Organization and Consumption Economics, Faculty of Human Nutrition and Consumer Sciences, Warsaw University of Life Sciences (SGGW-WULS), 159C Nowoursynowska Street, 02-787 Warsaw, Poland", "name": "Agnieszka Tekie\u0144"}], "link": [{"content_type": "pdf", "type": "fulltext", "url": "https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/9/11/1999"}], "abstract": "The main purpose of this study was to determine the structure of consumer preferences regarding information on farming system and nutritional enhancement of eggs to verify if consumers are willing to accept products combing sustainability and nutrition related claims.

Through a quantitative evaluation of scientific texts and conceptions of citizens, this study brings a reflection guided by different views about the factors that promote that consumption, often implying a vulnerability that requires the incorporation of new paradigms leading to conscious choices about the reality involved in the system of animal production. Although the diet is based on numerous biopsychosocial factors, the access to information, especially regarding scientific knowledge about animal consciousness, added to the consolidation of bioethics, contributes to the strengthening of a critical awareness about the treatment of animals, and potentially constitutes a stimulus for the decision to abstain from meat consumption. Vegetarianism, in its various expressions, does not always represent simply a nourishment habit, but a change of conduct aimed at a better interaction with nature, regardless of the academic area of training. Such a change can go beyond the aspect of animal welfare, reaching other spheres of abuse of subjects vulnerable to economic interests. Thus, changing ethical conceptions requires a rational decision that should be performed by consolidated ethical principles and intermediated by a dialogue promoted by sciences such as Environmental Bioethics, which proposes to mediate complex, globalized and plural issues to seek consensual solutions for all involved in this and in the future generations.", "title": "A abstin\u00eancia volunt\u00e1ria do consumo de carne pode ser compreendida como um princ\u00edpio \u00e9tico?"}, "created_date": "2016-07-13T23:22:13Z", "id": "0b3d868862cc49e0a24fa18d9cbc3ce2"}, {"last_updated": "2022-12-21T20:10:46Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "1751-7311", "type": "pissn"}, {"id": "10.1017/S1751731115002359", "type": "DOI"}], "journal": {"volume": "10", "number": "3", "country": "NL", "issns": ["1751-7311", "1751-732X"], "publisher": "Elsevier", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Animal"}, "end_page": "538", "keywords": ["maize silage", "fattening buffaloes", "meat quality", "animal welfare"], "year": "2016", "start_page": "531", "subject": [{"code": "SF1-1100", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Animal culture"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "Dipartimento di Agraria, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Via Universit\u00e0 100, 80055 Portici (Napoli), Italy", "name": "F.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of pre-slaughter handling, exercise and the presence of a dog on the behaviour and physiology of lambs and meat quality at slaughter. At 6 months of age, 60 lambs (n=20 lambs/replicate; three replicates) were allocated to one of the two treatment groups (n=30 lambs/treatment): low (LOW) intensive handling or high (HIGH) intensive handling. LOW lambs were moved short distances, quietly and without the use of a dog before transport. HIGH lambs were moved quickly, long distances and with a dog present before transport. Lamb behaviour (standing, lying, rumination and panting) was recorded for 1 h before (post-treatment) and after transport (post-transport), and for 30 min before slaughter (pre-slaughter). Blood samples were collected before (baseline), after transport (post-transport) and at exsanguination (at slaughter) to assess cortisol, lactate and non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations. At slaughter, lamb carcases (M. longissimus lumborum) were evaluated for pH levels, drip and cook loss, and tenderness. HIGH lambs spent more time standing (P<0.001) and panting (P<0.001) and less time lying (P<0.001) and ruminating (P<0.001) post-treatment than LOW lambs, but more (P<0.001) time ruminating post-transport. All lambs spent more time standing (P<0.001) and less time lying (P<0.001) and panting (P<0.001) post-transport and pre-slaughter than post-treatment. Cortisol concentrations were greater (P<0.001) in lambs post-transport and at slaughter compared with baseline values. Lactate concentrations were lower (P=0.002) in HIGH than LOW lambs. In addition, NEFA concentrations were higher (P<0.001) post-transport and at slaughter in HIGH compared with LOW lambs. Ultimate pH was higher (P<0.001) in HIGH than LOW lambs and pH declined quicker (P=0.012) in LOW than HIGH lambs. Cook loss, drip loss and shear force were lower (P\u2a7d0.05) in HIGH than LOW lambs.

For the evaluation of animal welfare, a selection of indicators set up in the European Project\u00ae assessment protocol for cattle 2009 was used. Environmental sustainability of milk production was assessed by a cradle-to-farm-gate Life Cycle Assessment. Laboratory analyses were carried out on bulk tank milk to evaluate microbiological, nutritional and nutraceutical quality. Nineteen variables were selected and retained to define six quality aspects: animal welfare, environmental and economic sustainability of farms, microbiological, nutritional and nutraceutical quality of milk. Each farm was visited twice; each visit received, for each variable, a score between 1 and 3 based on the frequency distribution of that variable in the farm sample. The relation among farm characteristics and quality aspects showed the importance to maximise dairy efficiency to improve environmental and economic sustainability of the farms and the inclusion of hay in dairy cows\u2019 ration to enhance the nutraceutical and nutritional quality of milk.

The article shows that animalistic discourse plays an important, if not central, part in Sebald\u2019s literary\u00a0imagination, which has gone largely unnoticed by critics for a long time, due to their predominant\u00a0focus on the issues of memory, the Holocaust, and melancholia. The main subjects of analysis here\u00a0are the novels The Rings of Saturn and Austerlitz, which are focused predominantly on the issue\u00a0of human-animal relationships both on a textual and on a visual level. Firstly, the author will characterise the images of animals depicted in Sebald\u2019s prose, then she will examine the animal cartographies, i.e. spaces where the writer locates his non-human protagonists, and in the end, the text\u00a0will analyse the poetics of contrast and analogy through which Sebald describes the entanglement of the human\u2019s mind in the exploitation of animals. The analysis will demonstrate that the coexistence of humans and animals in Sebald\u2019s works is not linear, but rather creates sophisticated constellations of ostensibly distanced events from various periods and sources. Sebald places an animal\u2019s\u00a0suffering right at the centre of the turbulent and disastrous history of the 19th and 20th centuries and, through this inclusive gesture of empathy towards non-human animals, strictly breaks with the anthropocentric perspective of writing.", "title": "Mieszka\u0144cy \u201eopacznego miniaturowego uniwersum\u201d.

Instead, we are obligated to justify our political actions to each other using reasons that everyone can accept. Thus, in the second section I suggest that our condition of reasonable pluralism inspires us to turn toward some form of contractarianism. The social contract tradition emerged precisely as an attempt to think about how a society characterized by deep moral disagreement could nonetheless agree about the basic principles of justice. I will show, in this section, that although the social contract tradition would seem to contain the best tools for thinking about how to deal with moral disagreement, it fails to help us think through the important issues of animal ethics.

Well, apparently, ALZ-112 will do the trick! If you don\u2019t believe me, then you need to watch Rise of the Planet of the Apes.\n\r\nThe scientific fiction movie, while showing the potential acting talent of apes, touches on ethical issues in the biopharmaceutical industry. Will Rodman, a research scientist for a biopharmaceutical company, Genesis, spent five years of his life working passionately on a cure for Alzheimer\u2019s. His work birthed ALZ-112, which was tested on an ape captured in a dramatic manner. His experiment with this single subject yielded positive results and so began his eagerness for human trials. Eventually, Rodman\u2019s ape, Caesar, yells out \u201cNO!\u201d\n\r\nThe first ethical issue the movie raises is the protection of animals used in science research. The star ape that had shown a favorable response to the drug, went rogue. Thus, all other apes involved in the experiment to be killed. This mirrors our real-world concern over the dispensability of animals to humans in research work. Is it ethically justifiable to eradicate an entire herd of research animals without investigation just because one of them has become potentially dangerous? Shouldn\u2019t there be other ways to ease an aggressive animal that doesn\u2019t involve a gun and bullets?\n\r\nThe second ethical issue the movie raises is autonomy and informed consent in clinical trials. Rodman, in his desperation to save his father from Alzheimer\u2019s, injected him with ALZ-112 while he was asleep. At this moment, his father had unknowingly entered into a one-man clinical trial for a drug that had not even gone through phase 1 safety testing. Tied closely to this is the issue of surrogacy for subjects with diminished or no autonomy. In this case, Rodman\u2019s father had diminished autonomy because of his memory loss and vulnerable condition. Normally, a caretaker or family member is expected to make this decision for such a patient and thus, will be responsible for protecting the patient from exploitation.

The principal stressor factors that piglets experience during transport include: mixing with unfamiliar animals, overcrowding, heat, cold, temperature fluctuations, vibrations, and noise. It is well known that all these factors contribute to raising the level of stress caused by the weaning process; however, the additional effects attributable to transport immediately after weaning impact the physiology, metabolism and behaviour of piglets, predisposing them to delayed growth. For this reason, animal transport must be well-planned and take into account such aspects as preparation of the piglets, choosing the best route and vehicle type, assuring adequate vehicle design and maintenance, and providing sufficient space. Also important for assuring the welfare of the piglets during transport are sufficient rest time, appropriate access to food and water, defined measures for monitoring the animals during the trip, implementing means of disease control, and establishing the steps to be followed in case of an emergency.", "title": "Stressor factors in the transport of weaned piglets: a review"}, "id": "1454955f01f74451aa71a99f7862bda8", "created_date": "2023-02-23T03:50:08Z"}, {"last_updated": "2022-12-21T18:42:58Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "0102-0935", "type": "pissn"}, {"id": "1678-4162", "type": "eissn"}], "journal": {"volume": "65", "number": "1", "country": "BR", "issns": ["0102-0935", "1678-4162"], "publisher": "Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais", "language": ["EN", "PT"], "title": "Arquivo Brasileiro de Medicina Veterin\u00e1ria e Zootecnia"}, "month": "02", "end_page": "36", "keywords": ["bem-estar animal", "curr\u00edculo", "dor animal", "ensino", "medicina veterin\u00e1ria", "animal welfare", "animal pain", "curricula", "programs", "veterinary medicine"], "year": "2013", "start_page": "29", "subject": [{"code": "SF1-1100", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Animal culture"}], "author": [{"name": "T.D.

The overall scenario of education in veterinary medicine on issues of animal welfare and pain was studied. This study was conducted through the analysis of documents available online and via questionnaires to coordinators of veterinary medicine programs. The program description, its curriculum and course content descriptions were considered. Results show that 46% of the 94 institutions studied offer an animal welfare course and 26% offer an ethology course. We observed a direct relationship with the physical component of animal welfare; the other two components, the behavioral and psychological ones, do not receive similar attention throughout the programs. In the study of course contents of the veterinary programs, the term 'animal welfare' is used in a diffuse manner and the term 'pain' appears in 54% of the programs studied, mainly related to disciplines covering its pathology, physiology, pharmacology and anesthesiology. We conclude that in the teaching of veterinary medicine in Brazil there is an emphasis on the physical realm of animal welfare, and that there is room for improvement in the naturalness and psychological realms and in the teaching of pain.", "title": "Ensino de bem-estar e dor animal em cursos de medicina veterin\u00e1ria no Brasil Teaching pain and animal welfare in Veterinary Medicine courses in Brazil"}, "created_date": "2013-09-03T04:53:47Z", "id": "154e386152324c319f48d6af1927200b"}, {"last_updated": "2022-12-21T20:53:18Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "1751-7311", "type": "pissn"}, {"id": "10.1017/S1751731113000487", "type": "DOI"}], "journal": {"volume": "7", "number": "7", "country": "NL", "issns": ["1751-7311", "1751-732X"], "publisher": "Elsevier", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Animal"}, "end_page": "1190", "keywords": ["animal welfare", "indicator", "sheep", "observer agreement", "sensitivity", "specificity"], "year": "2013", "start_page": "1182", "subject": [{"code": "SF1-1100", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Animal culture"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, Institute of Global Health and Infection, University of Liverpool, Leahurst, Neston CH64 7TE, UK", "name": "C.J.

Ten animal-based indicators assessed by observation \u2013 demeanour, response to stimulation, shivering, standing ability, posture, abdominal fill, body condition, lameness, eye condition and salivation were tested as part of the objective of developing valid, reliable and feasible animal-based measures of lamb welfare The indicators were independently tested on 966 young lambs from 17 sheep flocks across Northwest England and Wales during December 2008 to April 2009 by four trained observers. Inter-observer reliability was assessed using Fleiss's kappa (\u03ba), and the pair-wise agreement with an experienced, observer designated as the \u2018test standard observer\u2019 (TSO) was examined using Cohen's \u03ba. Latent class analysis (LCA) estimated the sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of each observer without assuming a gold standard and predicted the Se and Sp of randomly selected observers who may apply the indicators in the future. Overall, good levels of inter-observer reliability, and high levels of Sp were identified for demeanour (\u03ba = 0.54, Se \u2a7e 0.70, Sp \u2a7e 0.98), stimulation (\u03ba = 0.57, Se = 0.30 to 0.77, Sp \u2a7e 0.98), shivering (\u03ba = 0.55, Se = 0.37 to 0.85, Sp \u2a7e 0.99), standing ability (0.54, Se \u2a7e 0.80, Sp \u2a7e 0.99), posture (\u03ba = 0.45, Se \u2a7e 0.56, Sp = 0.99), abdominal fill (\u03ba = 0.44, Se = 0.39 to 0.98, Sp = 0.99), body condition (\u03ba = 0.72, Se \u2a7e 0.38 to 0.90, Sp = 0.99), lameness (\u03ba = 0.68, Se > 0.73, Sp = 1.00), and eye condition (\u03ba = 0.72, Se \u2a7e 0.86, Sp = 0.99). LCA predicted that randomly selected observers had Se > 0.77 (acceptable), and Sp \u2a7e 0.98 (high) for assessments of demeanour, lameness, abdominal fill posture, body condition and eye condition. The diagnostic performance of some indicators was influenced by the composition of the study population, and it would be useful to test the indicators on lambs with a greater level of outcomes associated with poor welfare.

However, non-human primates (NHP) and transgenic mice could be used  to address certain aspects of immunogenicity. Substantial efforts have been  made to reduce NHP use in biopharmaceutical drug development, e.g. study  design improvements and changes in regulatory policy. In addition, several  expert groups are active in this field (e.g. NC3Rs, BioSafe, and  Biopharmaceutical Technical Group). Despite that, there is an increasing  trend of use of NHP in preclinical safety testing of biopharmaceuticals,  especially regarding monoclonal antibodies. Other potential bioethical  issues related biopharmaceutical drug development are their  cost/effectiveness ratio, clinical safety assessment, production of  biosimilars, and comparison of their efficacy with placebo in countries  without intention to market.

There are five major reasons for this new social concern, most importantly, the replacement of husbandry-based agriculture with industrial agriculture. This loss of husbandry to industry has threatened the traditional fair contract between humans and animals, and resulted in significant amounts of animal suffering arising on four different fronts. Because such suffering is not occasioned by cruelty, a new ethic for animals was required to express social concerns. Since ethics proceed from preexisting ethics rather than ex nihilo, society has looked to its ethic for humans, appropriately modified, to find moral categories applicable to animals.

Data regarding animal characteristics and rearing, catching, transport and lairage conditions were collected on farm and at the slaughterhouse for 404 chicken broiler flocks processed during 2005. The average DoA rate was 0.18% (from 0% to 1.4%). Variables found to be associated (P < 0.05) with the DoA rate in a multivariable negative binomial model were flock cumulative mortality on farm, the catching system (mechanical being more at risk than manual), the density in crates (more space allowance being associated with less mortality) and climatic conditions (rain and wind being associated with more DoA).

This study obtained multiple logistic regression models with capacity of estimating the welfare of broiler breeders in relation to the environment of the aviaries and behaviors expressed by the birds. In the experiment, were observed several behaviors expressed by breeders housed in a climatic chamber under controlled temperatures and three different ammonia concentrations from the air monitored daily.

Forty two research protocols in 2006 and 24 in 2007 were evaluated. Animals used were mostly vertebrates being submitted more frequently to procedures considered B for invasiveness degree. The results show that the CEUA-SCA, in the studied period, collaborated to the control of the animal use under the responsibility of the SCA-UFPR. Further improvement relates to the need for proper formularies fulfilment by the proposers, the increase of plurality in the Committee composition and the importance of a federal agency centralizing the Brazilian CEUAs information.", "title": "Descri\u00e7\u00e3o de dois anos de atua\u00e7\u00e3o da Comiss\u00e3o de \u00c9tica no Uso de Animais do Setor de Ci\u00eancias Agr\u00e1rias da Universidade Federal do Paran\u00e1 Two years description of the Animal Use Ethic Committee of the Agrarian Science Sector of the Federal University of Paran\u00e1"}, "created_date": "2013-09-04T17:59:30Z", "id": "0d2cbf389fc24c79b354afb88056781d"}, {"last_updated": "2022-12-21T22:53:50Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "1751-7311", "type": "pissn"}, {"id": "10.1017/S1751731109004479", "type": "DOI"}], "journal": {"volume": "3", "number": "8", "country": "NL", "issns": ["1751-7311", "1751-732X"], "publisher": "Elsevier", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Animal"}, "end_page": "1166", "keywords": ["beef cattle", "sheep", "goats", "livestock", "animal welfare"], "year": "2009", "start_page": "1152", "subject": [{"code": "SF1-1100", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Animal culture"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "Centre for Animal Welfare and Ethics, School of Veterinary Sciences, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD 4072, Australia", "name": "C.J.C.

The objectives of this research were to determine the stress responses to tail docking in piglets and to compare two methods of tail docking; cautery iron (CAUT) and the more commonly used blunt trauma cutters (BT). At approximately 6 days of age, piglets were tail docked using CAUT (n = 20), BT (n = 20) or sham tail docked with their tails remaining intact (CON; n = 40). Blood samples were taken prior to tail docking and at 30, 60 and 90 min after tail docking to evaluate the effect of tail docking on white blood cell (WBC) measures and cortisol concentrations. The above experiment was repeated to observe behaviour without the periodic blood sampling, so as not to confound the effects of blood sampling on piglet behaviour. Piglet behaviour was recorded in the farrowing crate using 1 min scan-samples via live observations for 60 min prior to and 90 min after tail docking. Total WBC counts were reduced (P > 0.05) among BT and CAUT compared with CON piglets 30 min after tail docking. Cortisol concentrations were higher (P < 0.01) among BT compared with CON and CAUT piglets 60 min after tail docking. Cautery and BT-docked piglets spent more (P < 0.05) time posterior scooting compared with CON piglets between 0 and 15 min, and 31 and 45 min after tail docking. Piglets tail docked using CAUT and BT tended to spend more (P < 0.07) time sitting than CON piglets between 0 and 15 min post tail docking. Elevated blood cortisol can be reduced by the use of the CAUT rather than the BT method of tail docking.

Several variations of ET protocols have been reported most of they not based in controlled clinical studies but in the supposed pharmacological mechanisms of action of the used hormones, neither with pharmacokinetic studies nor considering the potential collateral effects on cow's fertility. Such collateral effects could be directly or indirectly related with the uncontrolled use of exogenous hormones, or with the time-related additional open days of donor and recipients, without considering the bioethics for animal experimentation. The huge proliferation of protocols for SOV and RS aims for improving both grade I and II (transferable or freezable embryos) embryo yield per transfer, and pregnancy rates for transferred embryos, without having achieved significant improvements during the last 20 years all around the world. In the present review we critic the use of exogenous hormones in bovine ET with emphasis in the rationality of indiscriminating use of exogenous hormones and embryo yield. Finally, we suggest several arguments on the bioethics of the protocols for SOV and RS in bovine ET.", "title": "Racionalidad de los esquemas de superovulaci\u00f3n y sincronizaci\u00f3n en la transferencia de embriones en bovinos: &iquest;terap\u00e9utica basada en la evidencia o ausencia de \u00e9tica?

The Animal Welfare Council of Belgium, an official body advising the Minister of Public Health, was asked to evaluate this complex question, including biological, ethical and socio-economic aspects, on the basis of the available peer-reviewed studies. In this context, this study reviews legal aspects (overview of the European legislation), zootechnic aspects (uses of the Belgian draught horse) and biological aspects (pain potentially related to docking; horses\u2019 welfare linked to insect harassment and hygiene, communication and reproduction) of tail docking in draught horses. We conclude that (1) there is no benefit for horses in tail docking, including Belgian draught horses, (2) potential advantages of docking are essentially in favour of humans and these advantages could be scrupulously re-evaluated, taking into account practices of other countries.

These disadvantages might be reduced if the layers are allowed to utilise their ability to forage to a higher degree thereby reducing the import of nutrients into the system and stimulating the hens to perform a natural behaviour. However, very little is known about the ability of modern high-producing layers to take advantage of foraging to cover their nutritional needs, and the aim of the present work was to clarify this subject. Six flocks, each of 26 hens and one cock, were moved regularly in a rotation between different forage crops for a period of 130 days. Half of the flocks were fed typical layer feed for organic layers and half were fed whole wheat. The forage crops consisted of grass/clover, pea/vetch/oats, lupin and quinoa. At the beginning of the experiment, wheat-fed hens had a lower intake of supplementary feed (wheat) and a lower laying rate, egg weight and body weight. However, after a period of 6 to 7 weeks, the intake of wheat increased to approximately 100\u00a0g per hen per day and the laying rate increased to the same level as for the hens fed layer feed. For both groups of hens egg weight and body weight increased during the remaining part of the experiment. Crop analysis revealed different food preferences for hens fed layer feed and wheat-fed hens. Wheat-fed hens ate less of the cultivated seeds, whereas the amounts of plant material, oyster shells, insoluble grit stone and soil were larger in the crops from wheat-fed hens. Floor eggs were significantly more frequent in the hens fed layer feed, whereas wheat-fed hens only rarely laid floor eggs. Irrespective of treatment, hens were found to have excellent health and welfare. We conclude that nutrient-restricted, high-producing organic layers are capable of finding and utilising considerable amounts of different feed items from a cultivated foraging area without negative effects on their health and welfare.", "title": "Whole wheat versus mixed layer diet as supplementary feed to layers foraging a sequence of different forage crops"}, "id": "5f15e9b967ce426290f5576faffe8b10", "created_date": "2021-06-05T07:04:57Z"}, {"last_updated": "2022-12-21T17:39:18Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "10.1590/S0100-69162007000400002", "type": "doi"}, {"id": "0100-6916", "type": "pissn"}], "journal": {"volume": "27", "number": "3", "country": "BR", "issns": ["0100-6916"], "publisher": "Sociedade Brasileira de Engenharia Agr\u00edcola", "language": ["EN", "ES", "PT"], "title": "Engenharia Agr\u00edcola"}, "month": "12", "end_page": "610", "keywords": ["bem-estar animal", "intera\u00e7\u00f5es", "suporte \u00e0 tomada de decis\u00e3o", "animal welfare", "interactions", "decision making support"], "year": "2007", "start_page": "596", "subject": [{"code": "S1-972", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Agriculture (General)"}], "author": [{"name": "Danilo F.

In particular, thanks to the presence of a litter area, these new housing systems are thought to satisfy the dust-bathing motivation of hens more than in conventional cages, in which no litter area is present. However, although apparently obvious, there is no concrete evidence that non-cage systems, particularly aviaries, satisfy hens' motivation to dust-bathe and thus improve hens' welfare in terms of dust-bathing behaviour. The aim of this study was to compare hens' dust-bathing motivation when housed for a long time under similar conditions to commercial conditions in laying aviaries (with litter) and in conventional cages (without litter). Three treatments were compared: hens reared in floor pens then housed in conventional cages, hens reared in furnished floor pens then housed in a laying aviary, and hens reared in rearing aviaries then housed in a laying aviary. All three treatments provided access to litter during the rearing period. After transfer to the laying systems, access to litter was maintained for the aviary hens but stopped for the cage hens. Twelve groups of four hens per treatment were tested 36 to 43 weeks after transfer. The hens were placed in sawdust-filled testing arenas, and latency to dust-bathe, duration and number of dust baths, and number of hens dust-bathing were recorded. Latency to dust-bathe was shorter, dust baths were longer and more numerous and more hens dust-bathed among cage hens than among aviary hens. Our results indicate that hens' motivation to dust-bathe was more satisfied in laying aviaries than in conventional cages. Thus, laying aviaries improve hens' welfare in term of dust-bathing behaviour compared with conventional cages.", "title": "Motivation to dust-bathe of laying hens housed in cages and in aviaries"}, "id": "80eede6000da4abdb7793376968c2a13", "created_date": "2021-06-05T07:04:58Z"}, {"last_updated": "2022-12-21T20:25:19Z", "bibjson": {"identifier": [{"id": "1751-7311", "type": "pissn"}, {"id": "10.1017/S1751731107658030", "type": "DOI"}], "journal": {"volume": "1", "number": "1", "country": "NL", "issns": ["1751-7311", "1751-732X"], "publisher": "Elsevier", "language": ["EN"], "title": "Animal"}, "end_page": "132", "keywords": ["animal welfare", "dairy cows", "milking interval", "milking rate", "teats"], "year": "2007", "start_page": "125", "subject": [{"code": "SF1-1100", "scheme": "LCC", "term": "Animal culture"}], "author": [{"affiliation": "Teagasc, Moorepark Dairy Research Centre, Fermoy, Co.

Holstein-Friesian cows (n\u00a0=\u00a060) were assigned post calving to a factorial arrangement of treatments; twice a day (TAD) milking on a high or low nutritional level; once a day (OAD) milking on a high or low nutritional level. Milking characteristics were recorded daily. Blood samples to evaluate changes in the composition of the blood cells, milk leakage, udder tension and locomotory ability were measured on four occasions. Teat-ends were classified for hyperkeratosis (HK) monthly post partum. TAD had longer daily milking times (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) compared with OAD cows. There was no effect of milking frequency or nutritional level on morning milking time, time to milk letdown or peak milk flow rate (P>0.05). High nutritional level cows had higher average flow-rates (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) than low nutritional level cows. Neither milking frequency nor nutritional level affected HK (P>0.05). However, HK values were positively correlated with daily milking time for OAD cows for 6 months of lactation (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). This correlation was significant (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) for cows milked OAD on high nutrition during the peak lactation period. OAD cows had higher levels of milk leakage compared with TAD cows during the month of May (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Cows on high nutrition milked OAD showed higher udder firmness scores than cows milked once or twice daily at the low nutrition level in June and July (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). OAD cows had higher locomotion scores compared with TAD cows (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Locomotion and udder firmness scores were significantly correlated for OAD in June (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). OAD cows had lower blood lymphocyte counts, numerically higher counts of neutrophil and a higher monocyte count at peak lactation compared with TAD cows suggesting that OAD cows had altered immune responses. The increase in milk leakage, higher udder firmness and locomotion scores in conjunction with changes in blood cells, suggests that OAD milking may have caused some discomfort to the cows during peak lactation.

Several types of animal behaviour were observed such as those parameters that are categorized to be main aggressive behaviours, butting, being butted, mounting and being mounted. Significant differences (P &lt; 0.05) were found in butting, being butted behaviours between HE and LE treatment groups. Mounting and being mounted behaviours were significantly different (P &lt; 0.05) in steers and heifers and between the seasons as well. Steers performed more incidents of mounting behaviour than heifers and it was the same for spring, during which animals had more mounting behaviours.

In the Nordic countries, 1\u201310% of the arable land was in organic production in 1999. Organic farming can be seen as an approach to agriculture where the aim is to create integrated, humane, environmentally and economically sustainable agricultural production systems. Principles like nutrient recycling, prevention rather than treatment and the precautionary principle are included in aims and standards. Animal welfare is another hallmark of organic livestock production but despite this, several studies have indicated severe health problems e.g. in organic poultry production in Denmark. Also the quality of animal food products in relation to human health, particularly the risk of zoonotic infections, has been debated. For these reasons there is a need for improvement of production methods and animal health status. Vets play an important role in this development through work in clinical practice and in research. On-farm consultancy should be tailored to the individual farmers needs, and the practitioner should be willing to take up new ideas and when needed, to enter a critical dialogue in relation to animal welfare.

The first group of eight reindeer was moved from their feeding corral to a selection corral, captured by lasso and stunned with a captive bolt outside the selection corral. The second group of seven reindeer was moved to the selection corral, captured by lasso and restrained, after which they were loaded onto a lorry- and transported for 1 hour and then slaughtered. The third group of eight reindeer was moved to the selection corral and herded directly onto the lorry, without any manual handling. They were transported for 5 h and then slaughtered. In both transport groups, four reindeer were fitted with pre-programmed automatic blood sampling equipment (ABSE). ABSE sampled blood at predetermined times via a jugular vein catheter. Ultimate pH-values in three muscles (Mm. longissimus, triceps brachii and biceps femoris) were significantly lower in the group carefully handled and transported for 5 h compared with the other two groups. The physiological mechanisms behind these results are discussed. Samples from M. semimembranosus were collected at slaughter and after 2, 6 and 10 days of refrigerated storage (+4 \u00b0C). The samples were analysed for total counts of aerobic bacteria (pour-plated in Tryptone Glucose Extract Agar, Difco, incubated at 20 \u00b0C and 30 \u00b0C, respectively for 72 h), coliform bacteria 37 \u00b0C (pour-plated in Violet Red Bile Agar, Oxoid, incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h), Enterococci (surface-plated onto Slantez and Bartley Agar, Oxoid, incubated at 44 \u00b0C for 48 h) and Bacillus cereus (surface-plated onto Blood Agar Plates (Blood Agar Base, Difco, supplemented with 5% defibrinated horse blood) 30 \u00b0C for 24 h). All samples fell in the range 'fit for consumption'. At slaughter, there was no difference in ASAT activity, urea and Cortisol concentrations between the two transported groups. However, the plasma ASAT activity and urea concentrations at slaughter were significantly lower in the non-transported group. In both transport groups, the plasma Cortisol concentrations increased during loading onto and unloading from the lorry. Abomasal lesions were observed in all treatment groups.
